# GCD_Project
Material for assignment on Getting and Cleaning and data


The following data is included here

File 1: File 2: File 3: File 4:

Purpose of this is to collect, work with, and present cleaned a data set

train/X_train.txt’: Training set.

‘train/y_train.txt’: Training labels.

‘test/X_test.txt’: Test set.

‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

‘train/subject_train.txt’: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

‘train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt’: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units ‘g’. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the ‘total_acc_x_train.txt’ and ‘total_acc_z_train.txt’ files for the Y and Z axis.

‘train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt’: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

‘train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt’: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
