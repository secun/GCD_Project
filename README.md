# GCD_Project
Material for assignment on Getting and Cleaning and data


The following data is included in this repoin GitHub

File 1: [R code](https://github.com/secun/GCD_Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) for getting the tidy data files
File 2: [Tidy data](https://github.com/secun/GCD_Project/blob/master/tidy.txt)
File 3: [Tidy (mean) data](https://github.com/secun/GCD_Project/blob/master/tidy.mean.txt)
File 4: [Data dictionary](https://github.com/secun/GCD_Project/blob/master/Codebook.Rmd) for the tidy data
 

Purpose of this is project is to collect data, process and work with it, and present a cleaned an tidy data set

The following data has been ised from the original [source](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)  data set
* train/X_train.txt’: Training set.
* train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
* test/X_test.txt: Test set.
* test/y_test.txt: Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

* train/subject_train.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

* train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units ‘g’. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the ‘total_acc_x_train.txt’ and ‘total_acc_z_train.txt’ files for the Y and Z axis.

* train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

‘train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt’: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
